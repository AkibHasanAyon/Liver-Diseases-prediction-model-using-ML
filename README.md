Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world and because of that it faces significant challenges in managing the health of its population. With limited healthcare resources and a high burden of infectious and non-communicable diseases, liver disease has emerged as a major public health concern. The situation is made considerably worse by the increase in viral illnesses like Hepatitis B and C as well as the restricted availability of medical facilities. In order to lower mortality and give patients appropriate treatment, it is necessary to diagnose liver illnesses. But the problem is treatments are not advanced in most of the rural areas of Bangladesh for which itâ€™s not possible detect disease early and accurately. To solve these problems, we propose a machine learning-based system for liver disease prediction. We used clinical data, including biochemical and demographic features as inputs. After necessary pre-processing, the dataset was trained using various machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and Explainable Boosting Machines (EBM). Among these, EBM achieved the highest test accuracy of 99.72% after hyperparameter tuning.
